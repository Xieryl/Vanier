Direct current: better for shorter distances
Alternative current: better for longer distances

Capacitors: controls the current and keeps it stable

Transformers: used to change the voltage in an alternating current

Resistors: controls how much energy goes somewhere

Grounding: avoids short circuits

Material used for using dissipator: gold copper and aluminum

transistor: switches powers and signal

heat sink: dissipates the heat

small battery coin: stores minimum energy to boot up pc

rectifior: stop negative current from passing

cold dissipation: dont need a mech fan; cools down by nature
hot dissipation: you need a fan heats up in return

    why we use the the command line interface?
cl is faster than gui in most cases 
    you need to use mouse to navigate
    some tools are only available in cli

cd: change directory; changes where you want to go
cd ..: goes back to the previous directory
cd ../..: goes back to the previous 2 directory
add / if you want to go through multiple directories
dir: views all directories and files
    <DIR> = directory
    if there is a number beside the file name, it represents the size; may also mean the it is a file or app
    dir /a shows all, even hidden; best to not use this too happen as windowss dont want you to mess with them
cls: clear screen/declutters ur command line
* [insert extension]: shows everything ending with x; * .png: shows everything that is a png
if you use the up arrow button, you can use previous commands used, basically your command history
the down arrow goes to the most recent command
ipconfig /? displays help at the command prompt
MD: Make Directory 
DIR /S tells the command dir to include all files and subcategories in the current folder
rmdir/rd: removes an empty directory
del: delete a file
copy con: create a file

exit: go back to normal user
how know if normal: $

pwd: show current directory
cal 1 10 1560: shows the calendar of 1/10/1560
who: who is on the system; who is logged in
clear: cleans the terminal
shutdown -c: cancels shutdown
cd ~: goes back to home
cp [file1][file2]: copy a file to another file
cp -i: will ask first before copying

vi [insertNameFile]: create a file/ can also open an existing file
i: insert mode/input mode
esc: command mode
:w : you will save and stay in the file
:wq : save and exit the file
:q! : exit file and not save changes
cat [fileName]: see the content of file while not in vi mode
rm: delete a file without warning
rm -i: will ask you if you wanna delete it
touch: create an empty file

while in command mode: 
    yy: copy a line
