Direct current: better for shorter distances
Alternative current: better for longer distances

Capacitors: controls the current and keeps it stable

Transformers: used to change the voltage in an alternating current

Resistors: controls how much energy goes somewhere

Grounding: avoids short circuits

Material used for using dissipator: gold copper and aluminum

transistor: switches powers and signal

heat sink: dissipates the heat

small battery coin: stores minimum energy to boot up pc

rectifior: stop negative current from passing

cold dissipation: dont need a mech fan; cools down by nature
hot dissipation: you need a fan heats up in return

a motherboard generally has 10 thin layers with patterns in each of them

    why we use the the command line interface?
cl is faster than gui in most cases 
    you need to use mouse to navigate
    some tools are only available in cli

    Decode
    Execute

    CRUD: C(reate) R(ead) U(pdate) D(elete)

    What is the CPU Clock Rate?

    Other components used with the cpu

    center of the bridge is called a core

    what are the cores 
    what are threads? Virtual cores
OS
    What is it?
        Manages the computer's memory and processes, software and hardware.
        Allows the user to communicate with the pc without hacing to know the computer's language.
    What is its job?
        Managaes all of the software and hardware of the computer.
        Allows programs to access the CPU, memory and storage.
        Uses GUI to help facilitate everything; icons buttons menus
    Types of OS
        Microsoft Windows
        macOS

    LED (Light emitting diode): type of bulb used in monitors 

    Types of Panels
    TN Panel (Twisted Nematic): 
        liquid crystal is twisted; most cheapest; high refresh rate and response time
    IPS Panel (In-plane-switching): 
        LCD panels; aligned parallel with glass; accurate colors
    VA Panel (Vertical alignment):
        the most mid of all of them; not bad not good at anything

    Monitor OLED (organic light-emitting diode):
        diff tech from led and LCD
        each pixel produce their own light 
        better color, brightness, contrast and image quality
        contrast of 100000:1 vs 1000:1
Troubleshooting
